# MedTracker - Medication Reminder App

Hey! This is my hackathon project for the healthcare track. I'm building a web app to help people remember to take their medications because I've seen my grandparents struggle with this.

## What I'm trying to build

A simple web application where users can:
- Add their medications with dosages and times  
- Get browser notifications as reminders
- Track if they took their medicine or not
- See their progress over time

## Current Status (1:00 PM checkpoint)

✅ Basic HTML structure created
✅ Started working on CSS styling  
🚧 Working on JavaScript functionality (in progress)
❌ Notification system (not started)
❌ Local storage (planned)

## Tech Stack I'm Using

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla - no frameworks)
- Browser localStorage for data
- Web Notification API for reminders
- Mobile-first responsive design

## My Progress So Far

I started by creating the basic HTML structure with a header, dashboard section for stats, and a form to add medications. The design is inspired by modern healthcare apps but I'm trying to keep it simple since I have limited time.

The CSS is taking longer than expected - I want it to look professional but also be mobile-friendly. Still figuring out the responsive design part.

## Challenges I'm Facing

1. Making the notification system work across different browsers
2. Storing data locally without a backend 
3. Creating a good user experience on mobile devices
4. Time management (this hackathon is intense!)

## What's Next

- Finish the JavaScript functionality
- Add the notification system
- Test on mobile devices
- Maybe add dark mode if I have time
- Better error handling

## Problem This Solves

According to research, 50% of people don't take their medications as prescribed. This can lead to serious health issues and even deaths. My app tries to solve this by making medication tracking simple and accessible.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Open index.html in browser
3. That's it! (No build process needed)

Still working on making this better. Any feedback would be great!
